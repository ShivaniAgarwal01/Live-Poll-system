## 🔌 Socket Events

### Teacher → Server
- `create_poll`
- `kick_student`
- `send_message`

### Student → Server
- `join`
- `vote`
- `send_message`

### Server → Clients
- `vote_update`
- `poll_timer`
- `poll_ended`
- `student_list`
- `chat_message`
- `chat_history`
- `kicked`

---

## ⏱ Poll Timer Logic

- Teacher selects duration before poll creation.
- Server controls countdown timer.
- Remaining time broadcast using `poll_timer`.
- When timer reaches 0:
  - Poll ends
  - `poll_ended` emitted
  - Teacher can create new poll

---

## 💬 Chat Message Format

```ts
{
  sender: string;
  role: "teacher" | "student";
  message: string;
}
```

- Sender name appears above message
- Teacher messages aligned right
- Student messages aligned left

---

## 📊 Vote Percentage Calculation

```js
const percentage = (optionVotes / totalVotes) * 100;
```

Results update in real-time using `vote_update`.

---
---

## 🔄 Application Flow

1. Teacher creates poll.
2. Server stores poll and starts timer.
3. Students vote.
4. Live updates broadcast to all clients.
5. Timer ends → poll closes.
6. Poll saved in history.
7. Teacher can start new poll.

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Room-based classrooms
- MongoDB integration
- Export poll results as CSV
- Chat timestamps
